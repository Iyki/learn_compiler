// left recursion preferred over right recursion (base case is last item?). because yacc works based on a stack. With right recursion, stack gets very very big

yywrap can help you to parse multiple files (not needed in this class though)
Never end program with 0 - can cause infinite loops. Instead return 1

run yacc with `-d` option in order to create a make file.

scores: scores score {$$ = $1 + $2;
                      printf("Total:")}

        | score {$$ = $1;}
score: NAME ':' NUM {$$ = $3;}

LLVM is extra credit for part 2

creating tree nodes list for recursive descent parser/grammer
stmts: stmt stmts {$$ = $1;
                   $$->push_back($2);}
      | stmt {$$ = new vector<astNode*>;
              $$->push_back($1);}
can also call printNodes()

symbol table can be used to keep track of variables, thus you can keep track of what is being used before declatation. It can be implemented as a stack of vectors. stack implemenatation is to preserve context and keep track of all variables in the current scope.
assignment: create the symbol table and the AST tree

item:
itemset:
closure:
    s1->s2.s3

LLVM IR: (ntermediate representation for LLVM??)
global optimization and basic blocks
context is used/created to make it thread-safe (not implemented in this class)
(ast.c, ast.h is the module)
Single Static Assignment (SSA) form:
        transform the code into a form such that every variable is assigned to only once
        resolve scenario where a variable is assigned to multiple times (like in if statement)

IR language: (happens before optimization, during and after)
  - local variables: start with '%'
  - global variables: start with '@'
  - constants: start with '#'?
  
look at the header files here
"/usr/include/llvm-c-15/llvm-c/"


sequence of calls for compiler
yyparse()
semanticAnalysis()
